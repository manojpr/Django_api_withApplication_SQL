The project is called MOMENTUM ( FBG ) . In this project i have tried to create an api which communicates with an SQL server and filters the data based on the parameters passed to it.  
These filters are obtained from the user using the application called momentum , this has the front end and uses ajax to filter the options in the drop down based on the selected value. 
Run the api server in port 8001 and application in port 8000(default).
